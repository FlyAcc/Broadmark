# Simulations Folder

By default, this is the folder in which generated .aabb and .postrot files are stored.
Files in the 'Recordings_AABBs" folder are meant to be used to benchmark broad phase algorithms.
Files in the 'Recordings_PositionRotation" are meant to be used by the simulation generation tool to view previously generated scenes or to run the splitting tool. If hard-disk space is a concern, you can safely delete this folder, as it is not used during benchmarks.
